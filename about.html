      <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>I am a pretty experienced programmer. I've been doing it for over 5 years.</p>
      <p>This website was built from the ground up in HTML. Took less than a day to make.</p>
      <p>I don't really do HTML as much as I used to. I focus mainly on python programs and Unity games.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>This site's purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to have a place to put things I've made (relating to programming). You can see my projects at the projects page!</p>
      <p>Though I may also put my blender stuff I do on my free time as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>What happened to the old website?</h3>        
      <p>The old website isn't gone forever. It's archived on my github page in a repository named "foxxgaming.github.io".</p>
      <p>As to why I changed the website, well I changed my username on github completely messing everything up. If I wanted to bring back the old site I'd have to duplicate the repository and rename it. I thought, since I'm going to make a new reposiotry why not remake the website. The old site was... a bit of a mess in terms of how the files were laid out.</p>
